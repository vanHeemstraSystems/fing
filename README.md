## 100 - Introduction

Network scanner & device blocking app for Internet security.

Fing helps you get the most out of your home network: see all the devices connected to your WiFi, monitor your Internet speed and security level, and block or limit internet time on specific devices. Take your WiFi protection to the next level with our apps for PC and mobile.

**WARNING**: **Fingbox** has been discontinued. However, it looks like they are moving all development to the “**Fing Desktop**” software. It runs on Windows or Mac, and if you have a dedicated PC, it works just like the Fingbox. 

Consider "**[Firewalla](https://firewalla.com/)**" als an alternative (hardware) for the same functionality as Fingbox once offered.

Better still, and less expensive, look into "pfSense" at https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/home-assistant-with-pfsense/
